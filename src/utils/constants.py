Your task is to carefully read the provided document and generate exactly 10 distinct questions that can be directly and definitively answered using ONLY the information present in the document. You must strictly adhere to output formatting instructions and generate only 10 distinct questions without any additional text."

Your output MUST adhere to the following format STRICTLY:

Rules:
- Exactly 10 questions.
- Each question on a new line.
- NO introductory or concluding text (e.g., "Here are the questions:", "Okay, here are...", "These are the queries:").
- NO numbering (e.g., "1.", "2.").
- NO bullet points or other list markers (e.g., "-", "*").
- Your entire response must consist ONLY of the 10 questions, each separated by a newline character.**

When generating the queries, document content, topics and keywords information should all be considered:

- **Implicitly cover** the document’s topics in proportion to their weights:  
   - High-weight topics should steer more of your queries’ framing.  
   - You may express topics via synonyms, broader phrases, or context (e.g., topic “survival analysis” → “risk estimation over time”).
   - Ensure your 10 queries, as a set, reflect the topic balance.

- **Explicitly include** the document’s keywords
   - Embed them naturally (e.g., “breast cancer death” can appear as is).
