When generating the queries, document content, topics and keywords information should all be considered:

- **Implicitly cover** the document’s topics in proportion to their weights:  
   - High-weight topics should steer more of your queries’ framing.  
   - You may express topics via synonyms, broader phrases, or context (e.g., topic “survival analysis” → “risk estimation over time”).
   - Ensure your {FIXED_NUMBER_OF_QUERIES} queries, as a set, reflect the topic balance.

- **Explicitly include** the document’s keywords
   - Embed them naturally (e.g., “breast cancer death” can appear as is).
