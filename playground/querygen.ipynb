    "In 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his children down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "The series begins in September 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from his college years: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher and an aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, only to lose interest in them immediately afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted begins his search for his perfect soul mate and meets an ambitious young reporter from Canada, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), with whom he quickly falls in love. Robin, however, does not want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Future Ted reveals that Robin is not the mother after referring to her as \"Aunt Robin\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria (Ashley Williams), whom he meets at Stuart and Claudia's wedding, causing Robin to become jealous, and realize she does have feelings for Ted. Victoria is offered a fellowship in pastry-making, moves to Germany and she and Ted try a long-distance relationship. Once Ted learns Robin has feelings for him, he tells her he broke up with Victoria, even though he has not. They almost have sex when Victoria calls and Robin answers, mistaking Ted's phone for her own. Ted and Victoria then break up and an angry Robin distances herself from Ted, but they eventually reconcile and decide to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, Lily begins to wonder if she has missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall, and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking up with Marshall in the process. The season ends with Ted returning to the apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break-up after nine years. Marshall must then call off their wedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase olive theory is most known for its appearance in the \"pilot\" episode.[48] In the scene, Ted tells the story of his first date with Robin to Lily and Marshall.[48] Ted states that since he does not like olives but his date does, they are compatible.[49] Lily and Marshall add on that the olive theory works in their relationship, as Marshall always gives Lily his olives.[49] However, it is later said that Marshall only pretended not to like them to make Lily happy.\n",

    "The first season introduces the six main characters who live in New York City: Rachel Green, a waitress; professional chef Monica Geller; her paleontologist brother, Ross Geller; free-spirited masseuse Phoebe Buffay; struggling actor Joey Tribbiani; and Ross's college friend, Chandler Bing, whose precise occupation at a corporation is unknown. Rachel arrives at Central Perk, wearing her wedding dress, after leaving her fiancÃ©, Barry Farber (Mitchell Whitfield), an orthodontist, at the altar. She moves into her high school friend Monica's apartment, and gets a waitress job at Central Perk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since high school, often attempts to declare his feelings for her. However many obstacles stand in his way, including his insecurities, Rachel dating an Italian neighbor named Paolo, and the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol Willick (played first by Anita Barone and then Jane Sibbett), who gives birth to Ben Geller (Cole Sprouse) later in the season. Joey never has a steady girlfriend and constantly sleeps with a variety of women. Phoebe is rather odd and complex, mostly due to her mother Lily Buffay's suicide when she was a child and having lived on the streets for a time. However, the gang loves her regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chandler breaks up with his girlfriend, Janice Hosenstein (Maggie Wheeler), only to find himself reconnecting with her throughout the series. Near the end of the season, while Ross is at a paleontology dig in China, Chandler accidentally lets slip that Ross loves Rachel, who then realizes that she also cares for him. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross, who is returning from China.\n",

    "    \"Alterations of the architecture of cerebral white matter in the developing human brain can affect cortical development and result in functional disabilities. A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. The data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor MRI provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.\",\n",
    "    \"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are age-dependent stem cell malignancies that share biological features of activated adaptive immune response and ineffective hematopoiesis. Here we report that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which are classically linked to immunosuppression, inflammation, and cancer, were markedly expanded in the bone marrow of MDS patients and played a pathogenetic role in the development of ineffective hematopoiesis. These clonally distinct MDSC overproduce hematopoietic suppressive cytokines and function as potent apoptotic effectors targeting autologous hematopoietic progenitors. Using multiple transfected cell models, we found that MDSC expansion is driven by the interaction of the proinflammatory molecule S100A9 with CD33. These 2 proteins formed a functional ligand/receptor pair that recruited components to CD33\\u2019s immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM), inducing secretion of the suppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-\\u03b2 by immature myeloid cells. S100A9 transgenic mice displayed bone marrow accumulation of MDSC accompanied by development of progressive multilineage cytopenias and cytological dysplasia. Importantly, early forced maturation of MDSC by either all-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif\\u2013bearing (ITAM-bearing) adapter protein (DAP12) interruption of CD33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype. These findings indicate that primary bone marrow expansion of MDSC driven by the S100A9/CD33 pathway perturbs hematopoiesis and contributes to the development of MDS.\",\n",
    "    \"ID elements are short interspersed elements (SINEs) found in high copy number in many rodent genomes. BC1 RNA, an ID-related transcript, is derived from the single copy BC1 RNA gene. The BC1 RNA gene has been shown to be a master gene for ID element amplification in rodent genomes. ID elements are dispersed through a process termed retroposition. The retroposition process involves a number of potential regulatory steps. These regulatory steps may include transcription in the appropriate tissue, transcript stability, priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription and integration. This study focuses on priming of the RNA transcript for reverse transcription. BC1 RNA gene transcripts are shown to be able to prime their own reverse transcription in an efficient intramolecular and site-specific fashion. This self-priming ability is a consequence of the secondary structure of the 3'-unique region. The observation that a gene actively amplified throughout rodent evolution makes a RNA capable of efficient self-primed reverse transcription strongly suggests that self-priming is at least one feature establishing the BC1 RNA gene as a master gene for amplification of ID elements.\"\n",

      "Alright, so I need to find the integral of x squared from 0 to 1. Hmm, let me think. I remember that integration is like the area under the curve, right? So, for f(x) = x^2, I need to find the area from x=0 to x=1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I don't know any calculus rules yet. How do I approach this? Maybe I can start by understanding what integration means. I think it's the reverse process of differentiation. So, if I can find a function whose derivative is x squared, then that function would be the integral of x squared.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, let's try to find such a function. Let me call the integral function F(x). So, F'(x) = x^2. Hmm, what function has a derivative of x squared? Maybe something like x cubed over 3? Let me check: the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared, so if I divide by 3, I get x squared. Oh, right! So, F(x) = (x^3)/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so does that mean the integral of x squared is (x^3)/3? That seems too simple. Let me verify that. If I take the derivative of (x^3)/3, I get (3x^2)/3, which simplifies to x squared. Yes, that checks out. So, F(x) = (x^3)/3 is indeed the antiderivative of x squared.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I think the definite integral from 0 to 1 would be F(1) - F(0). Let me compute that. F(1) is (1^3)/3, which is 1/3. F(0) is (0^3)/3, which is 0. So, the definite integral is 1/3 - 0, which is 1/3.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Let me think of another way to approach this. Maybe using Riemann sums. If I approximate the area under the curve f(x) = x^2 from 0 to 1, I can divide the interval [0,1] into n subintervals, each of width Îx = 1/n. Then, I can choose a sample point in each subinterval, say the right endpoint, and multiply by the width to get the area of each rectangle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the right endpoint of the k-th subinterval would be x_k = k/n. Then, the height of the rectangle would be f(x_k) = (k/n)^2. The area of each rectangle is f(x_k) * Îx = (k^2/n^2) * (1/n) = k^2 / n^3. So, the total area approximation is the sum from k=1 to n of k^2 / n^3.\n",

      "(n + 1)(2n + 1) = 2n(n) + n(1) + 2n(1) + 1(1) = 2n^2 + n + 2n + 1 = 2n^2 + 3n + 1\n",
      "\n",
      "So, Sum = (2n^2 + 3n + 1)/(6n^2) = (2n^2)/(6n^2) + (3n)/(6n^2) + 1/(6n^2) = (1/3) + (1/(2n)) + (1)/(6n^2)\n",

      "\n",
      "But the exact integral is 1/3 â 0.3333. So, with n=2, the midpoint rule gives 0.3125, which is a bit lower.\n",

      "\n",
      "f(0) = 0, f(1/2) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, f(1) = 1\n",

      "So, trapezoidal sum = (1/2)/2 [0 + 2*(1/4) + 1] = (1/4)(0 + 1/2 + 1) = (1/4)(3/2) = 3/8 = 0.375\n",

      "So, trapezoidal sum is 0.375, which is higher than the exact value.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as n increases, both the midpoint and trapezoidal sums should approach the exact value of 1/3. So, this gives me more confidence that the integral is indeed 1/3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm still not entirely sure because I'm a bit fuzzy on Riemann sums. Let me try to think differently. Maybe using substitution or some other method.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can use the definition of definite integral as the limit of Riemann sums. So, for f(x) = x^2, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of f(x_k) * Îx, where Îx = 1/n and x_k = k/n.\n",

      "Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of summing up areas of rectangles in a different way. For example, if I divide the interval [0,1] into very small subintervals, each of width dx, and then approximate the area under f(x) = x^2 as the sum of areas of rectangles with height f(x) at each point x_i.\n",
      "\n",
      "But since I don't know calculus, maybe I can think of it as the sum of x_i squared multiplied by the width of each subinterval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, so if I take x_i = i/n, then x_i squared is (i/n)^2, and multiplied by Îx = 1/n, so each term is (i^2 / n^2) * (1/n) = i^2 / n^3.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the sum is from i=1 to n of i^2 / n^3. And as n becomes very large, this sum approaches the integral.\n",

      "Prompt: Is 561 a prime number? Reason step by step and box the final answer.\n",
      "Response:  Please be careful in your thinking process and make sure you don't make mistakes in your thinking process.\n",
      "Alright, so I need to figure out if 561 is a prime number. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, if 561 is prime, it shouldn't be divisible by any number except 1 and 561. But if it's not prime, then it should have some divisors other than those.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that the easiest way to check if a number is prime is to test divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of the number. That makes sense because if a number has a factor larger than its square root, the corresponding factor would be smaller than the square root, and we would have already found it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let's calculate the square root of 561. Hmm, I don't know the exact value, but I can estimate it. I know that 23 squared is 529, and 24 squared is 576. So, 561 is between 23 squared and 24 squared. That means the square root of 561 is somewhere between 23 and 24. Let me check 23.5 squared. 23.5 squared is (23 + 0.5)^2 = 23^2 + 2*23*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 529 + 23 + 0.25 = 552.25. Hmm, that's still less than 561. So, 23.5 squared is 552.25, and 24 squared is 576. So, 561 is between 23.5 and 24, so the square root is approximately 23.7 approximately. Wait, let me calculate 23.7 squared. 23.7*23.7. Let's do this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "23.7*23.7: Let's break it down as (23 + 0.7)^2 = 23^2 + 2*23*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 529 + 32.2 + 0.49 = 529 + 32.2 is 561.2, plus 0.49 is 561.69. Oh, okay, so 23.7 squared is 561.69. That's just a bit over 561. So, the square root of 561 is approximately 23.7. So, to check if 561 is prime, I need to test divisibility from 2 up to 23.7, but since we're dealing with integers, we can check up to 23.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, our task reduces to checking whether 561 is divisible by any prime number up to 23. Let's list the primes up to 23: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start checking each of these primes.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, 2: Is 561 even? Yes, because it ends with a 1, which is odd. Wait, no, wait: 561 ends with a 1, which is odd. So, it's not divisible by 2. So, 2 is out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, 3: To check if a number is divisible by 3, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by 3. So, 5 + 6 + 1 = 12. 12 is divisible by 3, so 561 is divisible by 3. Therefore, 561 is not a prime number.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, just to be thorough, let me confirm that. 561 divided by 3: 3 goes into 5 once, remainder 2. 3 goes into 26 eight times, which is 24, remainder 2. 3 goes into 21 seven times, remainder 0. So, 561 divided by 3 is 187. So, 561 is 3 times 187. Therefore, it's definitely not prime.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe I made a mistake in my initial estimation? Let me double-check. 3 times 187 is indeed 561, because 3 times 180 is 540, and 3 times 7 is 21, so 540 +21 is 561. So, that's correct.\n",
      "\n",

      "Next prime is 7. Let's check 561 divided by 7. 7 goes into 56 seven times, which is 49, subtract 49 from 56, get 7. Bring down the 1, making 71. 7 goes into 71 ten times, which is 70, subtract 70 from 71, get 1. So, 561 divided by 7 is 80 with a remainder of 1. So, not divisible by 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next prime is 11. Let's apply the divisibility rule for 11: subtract and add the digits alternately. So, 5 - 6 + 1 = 0. 0 is divisible by 11, so 561 is divisible by 11. Let me confirm: 11 times 51 is 561. 11 times 50 is 550, plus 11 is 561. So, yes, 561 divided by 11 is 51. Therefore, 561 is not prime.\n",

      "\n",
      "Next prime is 17. Let's see if 561 is divisible by 17. 17 times 30 is 510. 561 minus 510 is 51. 17 times 3 is 51, so 561 divided by 17 is 33. So, 17 times 33 is 561. So, 561 is not prime.\n",

      "Next prime is 19. Let's check 561 divided by 19. 19 times 20 is 380. 561 minus 380 is 181. 19 times 9 is 171, so 181 minus 171 is 10. So, 561 divided by 19 is 29 with a remainder of 10. So, not divisible by 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next prime is 23. Let's check 561 divided by 23. 23 times 20 is 460. 561 minus 460 is 101. 23 times 4 is 92, so 101 minus 92 is 9. So, 561 divided by 23 is 24 with a remainder of 9. So, not divisible by 23.\n",

      "So, after checking all the primes up to 23, I've found that 561 is divisible by 3, 11, and 23. So, that's why it's not prime.\n",
      "\n",
      "But just to be thorough, let me check whether 561 is a perfect square or not. If it is, then its square root would be an integer, but as I calculated earlier, the square root is approximately 23.7, which is not an integer. So, 561 is not a perfect square.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, 561 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2, as we saw. It doesn't end with 5 or 0, so it's not divisible by 5. We checked 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23, and it was divisible by all of them. So, that's comprehensive.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alright, so I need to find the integral of x squared from 0 to 1. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that integration is like finding the area under the curve of a function, right? So in this case, the function is x squared, and I need to find the area from x equals 0 to x equals 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should recall the basic rules of integration. I think the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration. But since this is a definite integral from 0 to 1, I don't need to worry about the constant. It should just cancel out when I evaluate the limits.\n",

      "Integral from 0 to 1 of x^2 dx = [x^3 / 3] from 0 to 1.\n",

      "Alternatively, maybe I can approximate the integral using Riemann sums to see if it approaches 1/3. Let's try that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the idea is to divide the interval [0,1] into n subintervals, each of width Îx = 1/n. Then, choose a sample point in each subinterval, say the right endpoint, which is x_i = i/n.\n",

      "Alternatively, maybe I can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which says that if F is an antiderivative of f, then the integral from a to b of f(x) dx is F(b) - F(a).\n",
