{"doc_text": "Folding and Self-Assembly of the TatA Translocation Pore Based on a Charge Zipper MechanismWe propose a concept for the folding and self-assembly of the pore-forming TatA complex from the Twin-arginine translocase and of other membrane proteins based on electrostatic \"charge zippers.\"Each subunit of TatA consists of a transmembrane segment, an amphiphilic helix (APH), and a C-terminal densely charged region (DCR).The sequence of charges in the DCR is complementary to the charge pattern on the APH, suggesting that the protein can be \"zipped up\" by a ladder of seven salt bridges.The length of the resulting hairpin matches the lipid bilayer thickness, hence a transmembrane pore could self-assemble via intra- and intermolecular salt bridges.The steric feasibility was rationalized by molecular dynamics simulations, and experimental evidence was obtained by monitoring the monomer-oligomer equilibrium of specific charge mutants.Similar \"charge zippers\" are proposed for other membrane-associated proteins, e.g., the biofilm-inducing peptide TisB, the human antimicrobial peptide dermcidin, and the pestiviral E(RNS) protein.", "query": "The arm density of TatAd complexes is due to structural rearrangements within Class1 TatAd complexes such as the 'charge zipper mechanism"}
{"doc_text": "PTEN Regulates PI(3,4)P2 Signaling Downstream of Class I PI3KThe PI3K signaling pathway regulates cell growth and movement and is heavily mutated in cancer.Class I PI3Ks synthesize the lipid messenger PI(3,4,5)P3.PI(3,4,5)P3 can be dephosphorylated by 3- or 5-phosphatases, the latter producing PI(3,4)P2.The PTEN tumor suppressor is thought to function primarily as a PI(3,4,5)P3 3-phosphatase, limiting activation of this pathway.Here we show that PTEN also functions as a PI(3,4)P2 3-phosphatase, both in vitro and in vivo.PTEN is a major PI(3,4)P2 phosphatase in Mcf10a cytosol, and loss of PTEN and INPP4B, a known PI(3,4)P2 4-phosphatase, leads to synergistic accumulation of PI(3,4)P2, which correlated with increased invadopodia in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated cells.PTEN deletion increased PI(3,4)P2 levels in a mouse model of prostate cancer, and it inversely correlated with PI(3,4)P2 levels across several EGF-stimulated prostate and breast cancer lines.These results point to a role for PI(3,4)P2 in the phenotype caused by loss-of-function mutations or deletions in PTEN.", "query": "Inositol lipid 3-phosphatase PTEN converts Ptdlns(3,4)P 2 into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate."}

{"doc_text": "Cyclin A Regulates Kinetochore-Microtubules to Promote Faithful Chromosome SegregationThe most conspicuous event in the cell cycle is the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase.Chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules.Notably, numerous kinetochore-microtubule (k-MT) attachment errors are present in early mitosis (prometaphase), and the persistence of those errors is the leading cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability.How robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown.Here we show that k-MT attachments in prometaphase cells are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells.The switch to more stable k-MT attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin A in prometaphase.Persistent cyclin A expression prevents k-MT stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes.By contrast, k-MTs are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-A-deficient cells.Consequently, cells lacking cyclin A display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation.Thus, the stability of k-MT attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase.Cyclin A creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation.", "query": "Cyclin A2 destruction is necessary to switch from unstable to stable kt-mt attachments in mitosis."}
{"doc_text": "Guanylate binding protein 1 is a novel effector of EGFR-driven invasion in glioblastomaAlthough GBP1 (guanylate binding protein 1) was among the first interferon-inducible proteins identified, its function is still largely unknown.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation by amplification or mutation is one of the most frequent genetic lesions in a variety of human tumors.These include glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is characterized by independent but interrelated features of extensive invasion into normal brain parenchyma, rapid growth, necrosis, and angiogenesis.In this study, we show that EGFR activation promoted GBP1 expression in GBM cell lines through a signaling pathway involving Src and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.Moreover, we identified YY1 (Yin Yang 1) as the downstream transcriptional regulator regulating EGFR-driven GBP1 expression.GBP1 was required for EGFR-mediated MMP1 (matrix metalloproteinase 1) expression and glioma cell invasion in vitro.Although deregulation of GBP1 expression did not affect glioma cell proliferation, overexpression of GBP1 enhanced glioma cell invasion through MMP1 induction, which required its C-terminal helical domain and was independent of its GTPase activity.Reducing GBP1 levels by RNA interference in invasive GBM cells also markedly inhibited their ability to infiltrate the brain parenchyma of mice.GBP1 expression was high and positively correlated with EGFR expression in human GBM tumors and cell lines, particularly those of the neural subtype.Together, these findings establish GBP1 as a previously unknown link between EGFR activity and MMP1 expression and nominate it as a novel potential therapeutic target for inhibiting GBM invasion.", "query": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is characterized by extensive invasion, rapid growth, necrosis, and angiogenesis."}
{"doc_text": "Endosome-ER Contacts Control Actin Nucleation and Retromer Function through VAP-Dependent Regulation of PI4PVAP (VAPA and VAPB) is an evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored protein that helps generate tethers between the ER and other membranes through which lipids are exchanged across adjacent bilayers.Here, we report that by regulating PI4P levels on endosomes, VAP affects WASH-dependent actin nucleation on these organelles and the function of the retromer, a protein coat responsible for endosome-to-Golgi traffic.VAP is recruited to retromer budding sites on endosomes via an interaction with the retromer SNX2 subunit.Cells lacking VAP accumulate high levels of PI4P, actin comets, and trans-Golgi proteins on endosomes.Such defects are mimicked by downregulation of OSBP, a VAP interactor and PI4P transporter that participates in VAP-dependent ER-endosomes tethers.These results reveal a role of PI4P in retromer-/WASH-dependent budding from endosomes.Collectively, our data show how the ER can control budding dynamics and association with the cytoskeleton of another membrane by direct contacts leading to bilayer lipid modifications.", "query": "ER-localized phosphatase Sac1 processes PI4P through coordination with OSBP and the endosome-localized protein sorting nexin 2."}
