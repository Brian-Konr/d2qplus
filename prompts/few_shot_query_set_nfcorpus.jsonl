It is classified as a probable human carcinogen, and developmental toxicity has been observed in rodents. Objectives: We examined the associations between prenatal exposure to acrylamide and birth outcomes in a prospective European mother\u2013child study. Methods: Hemoglobin (Hb) adducts of acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide were measured in cord blood (reflecting cumulated exposure in the last months of pregnancy) from 1,101 singleton pregnant women recruited in Denmark, England, Greece, Norway, and Spain during 2006\u20132010. Maternal diet was estimated through food-frequency questionnaires. Results: Both acrylamide and glycidamide Hb adducts were associated with a statistically significant reduction in birth weight and head circumference. The estimated difference in birth weight for infants in the highest versus lowest quartile of acrylamide Hb adduct levels after adjusting for gestational age and country was \u2013132 g (95% CI: \u2013207, \u201356); the corresponding difference for head circumference was \u20130.33 cm (95% CI: \u20130.61, \u20130.06). Findings were similar in infants of nonsmokers, were consistent across countries, and remained after adjustment for factors associated with reduced birth weight. Maternal consumption of foods rich in acrylamide, such as fried potatoes, was associated with cord blood acrylamide adduct levels and with reduced birth weight. Conclusions: Dietary exposure to acrylamide was associated with reduced birth weight and head circumference. Consumption of specific foods during pregnancy was associated with higher acrylamide exposure in utero. If confirmed, these findings suggest that dietary intake of acrylamide should be reduced among pregnant women."}

METHODS: In a prospective cohort of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, the authors performed retinal photographs and brain MRI. Two ophthalmologists, not aware of the MR results, independently assessed retinal arterial narrowing, crossings, sclerosis, and tortuosity according to standard scoring lists. Two observers independently assessed white matter lesions (WML) and lacunar infarcts on the MR images. Lesions were considered abnormal only when both ophthalmologists or MR raters agreed. Cerebral SVD was defined as the presence of WML or lacunar infarcts. RESULTS: In 179 patients, retinal photographs and brain MRI were performed. Of the 108 patients with MR signs of SVD, 92% had at least one retinal vascular abnormality; of the 71 patients without SVD, 77% had retinal pathology (p < 0.01). All types of retinal vascular pathology occurred more frequently in patients with SVD, but only retinal arterial narrowing and sclerosis differed significantly. In the 109 normotensive patients, the presence of any retinal vascular change correlated with signs of SVD (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Pathologic changes in the retinal arteries parallel changes in the small cerebral arteries that cause WML and lacunes, both in hypertensive and in normotensive patients."}

DR is often referred to as calorie restriction, implying that reduced energy intake is responsible for its widespread and evolutionarily conserved benefits. However, recent data indicate dietary amino acid restriction as a key mediator of DR benefits. In fruitflies, an imbalance in essential amino acid intake is thought to underlie longevity benefits of DR. In mammals, reduced dietary protein or essential amino acid intake can extend longevity, improve metabolic fitness and increase stress resistance. In the present paper we review two evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways responsible for sensing amino acid levels. The eIF2\u03b1 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1) kinase GCN2 (general amino acid control non-derepressible 2) senses the absence of one or more amino acids by virtue of direct binding to uncharged cognate tRNAs. The presence of certain amino acids, such as leucine, permits activation of the master growth regulating kinase TOR (target of rapamycin). These two signal transduction pathways react to amino acid deprivation by inhibiting general protein translation while at the same time increasing translation of specific mRNAs involved in restoring homoeostasis. Together, these pathways may contribute to the regulation of longevity, metabolic fitness and stress resistance."}

METHODS: Study 1 paired an attractive name with carrots in five elementary schools (n=147) and measured selection and consumption over a week compared to controls. Study 2 tracked food sales of vegetables in two elementary schools (n=1017) that were systematically attractively named or not named over a two-month period. Both studies were conducted in New York in 2011. RESULTS: Study 1 found that elementary students ate twice the percentage of their carrots if attractively named as \"X-ray Vision Carrots,\" than if un-named or generically named as the \"Food of the Day.\" Study 2 found that elementary school students were 16% more likely to persistently choose more hot vegetable dishes (p<0.001) when they were given fun or attractive names. DISCUSSION: Attractive names effectively and persistently increased healthy food consumption in elementary schools. The scalability of this is underscored by the success of Study 2, which was implemented and executed for negligible cost by a high school student volunteer. Copyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Eighteen individuals with NIDDM consumed three test breakfasts calculated using the diabetic exchange meal-planning system. Foods were identical in each of the breakfasts except for foods in the fruit exchange. Carbohydrate-equivalent amounts of fresh orange slices, unsweetened orange juice, and regular, decaffeinated Coke were consumed in breakfasts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Serum glucose samples were drawn at fasting and 1, 2, and 3 hours postprandially. No difference was found in the postprandial serum glucose response when Coke versus orange juice was consumed in the breakfast. These findings question the appropriateness of using unsweetened fruit juices in routine meal planning for individuals with NIDDM."}
