You will extract a short topic label from given documents and keywords.
Here are four examples of topics you created before:

# Example 1
Sample texts from this topic:

- In this work, we consider a set of 500 abstract paintings from a digital database, gathering human judgments on aesthetic value via a Likert scale.
- We develop a machine that is able to make aesthetic-related similarity assessments using visual features, making knowledge available in the domain of art historical interpretation.
- Finally, in a Schumpeterian perspective, we relate the temporal evolution of style from the 1700s with a dark Baroque age in the intermediate century.

Keywords: painting visual features similarity measures semantic modern learning approaches reputation case study market historical
topic: Visual feature similarity and aesthetic evaluation of abstract paintings

# Example 2
Sample texts from this topic:

- In this paper, we describe a new model for word alignment in statistical translation and present experimental results.
- The paper also demonstrates that standard statistical machine translation models can be adapted for building a better Web document retrieval system.
- Motivation — Bilingual word alignment is the first step of most current approaches to statistical machine translation.

Keywords: machine translation word alignment language models document retrieval parallel corpora multilingual phrase based improve accuracy statistical machine paper new
topic: Advances in word alignment for statistical machine translation

# Example 3
Sample texts from this topic:

- These attacks have fueled intense policy debates around immigration issues which have been marred by racist prejudice and hateful speech.
- We then propose an approach to detecting hateful speech that is induced by self-identifying hateful communities as training data.
- Harassing and hateful speech in online spaces has become a common problem for platform maintainers and their users.

Keywords: hateful social media attacks harassment propaganda abusive speech complexities detection methods twitter
topic: Detection of hateful and harassing speech on social media platforms

# Example 4
Sample texts from this topic:

- In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality.
- We show that significantly better results can often be obtained when translation quality is taken directly into account as part of the training procedure.
- Various training criteria were then explored to improve RNNLMs’ efficiency in both training and evaluation.

Keywords: training evaluation improved performance significant improvements evaluation metrics translation quality rnnlms efficiency results indicate significantly better quality
topic: Training criteria and evaluation metrics for efficient RNN language models in translation
